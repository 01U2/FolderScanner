**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**  
I'm always frustrated when I need to know not just the folder structure, but also details about the files within those folders. Currently, the tool only reports on folders, so I have to manually check file contents, which is time-consuming.

**Describe the solution you'd like**  
I would like the tool to include an option to scan and report on the files contained within each folder. The report should list file names, sizes, types, and optionally a preview or summary of their contents (e.g., first few lines or metadata). This information should be included in the exported Excel report.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**  
I have considered using separate file management tools or scripts to gather file information, but integrating this feature into FolderScanner would provide a more seamless and efficient workflow.

**Additional context**  
This feature would be especially useful for auditing, organizing, or migrating large collections of documents. A sample output or screenshot of the desired report format could be provided if needed.
